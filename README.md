# Shape Calculator

This project implements a shape calculator in Python, providing classes for rectangles and squares with various functionalities.


## Features

- Calculate area, perimeter, and diagonal of rectangles
- Generate a simple ASCII art representation of rectangles
- Determine the number of smaller shapes that fit into a larger shape

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/aymane66/shape-calculator.git


2. Change into the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd shape-calculator

3. Run your Python scripts:
    ```bash
    python main.py


## Usage
The project consists of two main files:

- shape_calculator.py: Contains the implementation of the Rectangle and Square classes.
- main.py: Example usage of the implemented classes.


This will showcase the functionality of the Rectangle and Square classes, including calculations and ASCII art representation.
